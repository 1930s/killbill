                </div>
                <p class="lead">Killbill is project aimed at handling online subscription management and its associated billing component. We started this project as part of <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a> to replace our existing billing system. We decided to open source the project so others can also benefit from it.</p>
                <p>The core of the project is a library that takes as an input a powerful catalog and offers a set of APIs to manage accounts and their subscriptions. The system detects subscriptions events (creation/cancellation/change) to automatically create new invoices and attempt making payments. In addition to the core library, there is also a web server module that offers a set of REST endpoints, an administrative UI, and some client libraries (php, java, ruby, javascript) offering a complete stack.</p>
                <p>The payment system is architected as a plugin framework where one can add its own plugin-- for instance a Paypal plugin or a plugin for some specific payment gateways. By default the system comes with a noop plugin that does not do anything.</p>

                    <h1>Quick overview of the Abstractions</h1>
                </div>
                <p class="lead">A user can create a <b>Subscription</b> by specifying a <b>Plan</b>. The set of existing plans are configured in a catalog, where each plan has a set of <b>Phase</b>s. Existing currently supported phases are trials, discounts, evergreen and each phase is defined with some attributes such as a set of prices and a length. Subscriptions have a type; currently supported types are BP (base pan), AO (addon) and standalone. Subscriptions are grouped together in a <b>Bundle</b> to allow specifying business rules across a group of subscriptions. An example is to create one BP along with multiple AOs in a bundle and specify that upon BP cancellation AO should also be cancelled.</p>

                        <li>Allow to specify the business logics associated with cancellation, or change of plans; an example is for instance to specify whether a cancellation should occur immediately triggering some proration logics or occurring at the end of its term (EOT) to avoid any proration. <a href="" >see catalog rules (TODO)</a></li>
                        <li>Allow to specify Billing alignments to decide which subscriptions should be billed together; an example is to create an invoice at the account level where each subscriptions on this account appear in one invoice.</li>
                        <li>Allow to specify Plan alignments; an example of such alignment allows to define whether changing from one plan to another one will end up restarting from the very first phase of the second plan or not <a href="" >see catalog alignment rules (TODO)</a> </li>
