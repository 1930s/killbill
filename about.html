      In April 2010, Ning made an unusual decision to switch from a
      free advertising funded business model to a fully paid
      subscription model. In three months we had to build the
      capability to manage what turned out to be around 100,000
      subscriptions. We naturally employed the services of a cloud
      based billing provider and managed to meet the deadline.
      However, over the following year we continued to develop our
      system and were continually frustrated by small gaps in our
      billing partner's functionality. They didn't have a concept of
      free trials, nor did they support discounts or add-ons. So, we
      set about incrementally wrapping their solution with layers of
      our own business logic to meet our needs. The result was a
      complex and error prone integration. We were trying to use
      their core functionality in ways that they hadn't intended. It
      was hard to test and full of special little rules that broke
      as soon as you tried to add something new. Ultimately it
      became so difficult to maintain that we decided we could no
      longer add functionality and instead we needed to stop, step
      back and start from scratch. This is how Kill Bill was born.<br>

      Kill Bill is a billing solution that was designed from the
      outset to fix these shortcomings. It can be configured to
      implement a wide range of business rules natively and provides
      a plugin architecture to allow custom business logic to be
      added.<br>
