      <p>Kill Bill sits at the center of your business. It
        understands your catalog and manages customer purchases and
        plan changes (upgrades, downgrades and cancellations). It
        knows what plans a customer has subscribed to and can
        provide that information to other systems, including your
        product. It creates invoices on a regular basis, triggers
        payments against your payment providers (PayPal, Credit Card
        Gateway etc.) and can produce finance reports and business
        analytics.<br>
      </p>
      All subscription management services provide these basic
      functions. What makes Kill Bill different is that we provide
      you with the flexibility to truly customize the system to your
      needs. We believe that it is critically important that the
      billing system owns all the business logic to manage how plan
      changes take place or which add-ons are available to a given
      plan, or even to manage the custom business logic&nbsp; around
      promotions or dunnings that sets you apart from your
      competition. To support these advanced features Kill Bill has
      flexible rules that can express a wide variety of plan changes
      and cancellation behaviors, but for when that's not enough,
      you can add your own custom logic to Kill Bill in the form of
      Plugin code that can customize the system behavior to meet
      your specific needs.</section>

      <h3> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
      <h3>Core Features</h3>
      Kill Bill is a fully fledged subscription billing system. This
      section outlines the features that it shares with many
      comparable products on the market.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subscription Management:</span>
      Kill Bill can<br>
      <ul>
        <li>create and cancel subscriptions associated with a
          billing plan</li>
        <li>upgrade and downgrade between plans</li>
        <li>charge customers on a fixed or recurring basis with
          support for multiple billing periods (monthly, quarterly,
          annual etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoices and Proration:</span>
      Kill Bill generates invoices, when they are required and can
      prorate off cycle charges onto a single recurring bill cycle.
      For example, if you have a customer who is billed on the 15th
      of every month and they buy a product on the 1st of January,
      Kill Bill can correctly charge them for the partial month 1st
      - 15th January and then continue to bill them every 15th of
      the month with the new subscription combined with the others.
      Invoices can be automatically emailed to customers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments: </span>Kill Bill
      triggers payments with your payment providers as soon as an
      invoice has been generated. Payment failure notices can be
      automatically mailed out to customers (also see Overdue
      Enforcement in the Advanced sections). Kill Bill interfaces
      with payment providers via plugin API's that make it easy to
      add new payment providers if you need to interface with
      providers that we do not already support. [Note: plugins for
      Litle and PayPal are currently under development]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting and
        Analytics:&nbsp; </span>Kill Bill supports finance
      reporting (revenue recognition, aging etc.) and business
      dashboards for monitoring acquisition, monthly recurring
      revenue and churn. The reports and analytics can be driven off
      a separate database so that they do not impact production
      performance. [Note: reports and dashboards are currently under
      development]<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Advanced Features<br>
      </h3>
      This section outlines some of the advance features that make
      Kill Bill a little different - and by different we mean
      better.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-phase plans: </span>Do
      you need a plan that offers a 30 day trial followed by&nbsp; a
      6 month discount period and then transitions to a full price
      evergreen subscription? No problem. Kill Bill supports the
      configuration of plans with multiple phases, each phase can
      specify its own pricing and even billing term.<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan change rules: </span></span>Do

      you need to have trials cancel immediately but have paid plans
      cancel at the end of their term? Maybe you want upgrades to
      take place immediately but downgrades to happen at the end of
      term? All of this is business logic that should live in the
      billing system not in applications. Kill Bill natively
      supports powerful change rules that ensure that plan changes
      and cancellations happen according to your policies. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Product tiers and add-ons:</span>
      So, you want three tiers of product with some add-ons only
      available to the top tier customers. Kill Bill has native
      support for tiered products and add-ons, allowing you to
      specify which add-ons are available on which product tiers and
      if the customer downgrades automatically cancel add-ons that
      are no longer available. Of course, Kill Bill can tell you
      what it's going to do before you do it so your users can
      confirm.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"> <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price lists: </span></span></span>You

      want to offer a special set of prices to customers coming in
      through one of your partners. They get a 30% price for six
      months. But what happens if they upgrade during those six
      months? Maybe you want them to stay in the same price list and
      get 30% off the new plan, but only for the remainder of the
      discount period. With Kill Bill you can arrange plans into
      Price Lists and provide Plan Change rules to specify exactly
      he behavior you need.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
            Overdue Enforcement:</span></span></span> Kill Bill
      allows you to write rules<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;"> </span></span></span>to specify what happens
      when a customer payment fails. You can choose to take
      different actions based on the payment failure type, the
      customer's plan, the time since the last unpaid invoice etc.
      This allows you to build multi-phased enforcement where the
      customer can receive warnings and have features gradually
      removed until they are finally shut down.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
            Internationalization: </span></span></span>Kill Bill
      understands the internationalization of currency
      representation, so that it provides the correct decimal
      separator, number of decimal places and rounding rules for
      each locale. All customer interactions, emails, invoices etc.
      are fully internationalized so you can create invoice and
      email templates to match the locales of your customers. [Note:
      this feature is currently incomplete]<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
            Time zones: </span></span></span>You have a customer in
      Japan that buys a product on March 3rd. However, your
      California based billing provider sends her invoices that
      start her subscription on March 2nd because it was still March
      2nd in California when the purchase was made. This can be very
      confusing to customers. Kill Bill does time zones right. Your
      customer accounts have a time zone associated with them and
      your customers are invoiced in that time zone.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Event based: </span></span></span>Most

      cloud based providers have offline billing and payment runs
      that introduce a delay of sometimes up to 48 hours between
      when a customer signs up and when their card is charged. Kill
      Bill runs as an event based system, as soon a subscription is
      created that triggers an event, which triggers the creation of
      an invoice, and in turn, triggers a payment. The customer's
      card will be charged within seconds of signing up which is
      better for you and less confusing for them.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
          bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
            Coupons:</span></span></span> Need a way to let some of
      your customers access that special discount price list? Kill
      Bill lets you create and manage coupons. Each coupon has an
      expiry date (can be unlimited) and a maximum number of uses
      (can also be unlimited) and gets mapped to a specific price
      list. [Note: this feature is under development]<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
            style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
            <br>
          </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
            bold;"></span></span></span>
      <h3>Plugins</h3>
      In today's world the ability to rapidly test and roll out
      promotions, alternate pricing models<span style="font-weight:
        bold;"></span> and custom billing features is critical to
      your companies ability to compete. With conventional
      cloud-based subscription solutions you are limited to the
      capabilities that they offer. Before Kill Bill the only way to
      have complete control over your billing behavior was by
      building your own billing system from scratch and few
      companies have the skills or resources to do that. Kill Bill
      resolves this dilemma by providing the first Billing Platform.
      Our plugin architecture allows you to add custom logic that
      can be triggered by events in the system. Which means that the
      only logic that you need to build are the customizations.<br>
      <br>
      Our plugin system uses the <a

      Java or Ruby [Scala under development].<br>
