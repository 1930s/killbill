            <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
          </div>
          <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 600px;
              height: 413px;" alt="Functions of Kill Bill"
              src="Features_files/KillBillFunctions.png"><br>
          </div>
          <p>Kill Bill sits at the center of your business. It
            understands your catalog and manages customer purchases and
            plan changes (upgrades, downgrades and cancellations). It
            knows what plans a customer has subscribed to and can
            provide that information to other systems, including your
            product. It creates invoices on a regular basis, triggers
            payments against your payment providers (PayPal, Credit Card
            Gateway etc.) and can produce finance reports and business
            analytics.<br>
          </p>
          All subscription management services provide these basic
          functions. What makes Kill Bill different is that we provide
          you with the flexibility to truly customize the system to your
          needs. We believe that it is critically important that the
          billing system owns all the business logic to manage how plan
          changes take place or which add-ons are available to a given
          plan, or even to manage the custom business logic&nbsp; around
          promotions or dunnings that sets you apart from your
          competition. To support these advanced features Kill Bill has
          flexible rules that can express a wide variety of plan changes
          and cancellation behaviors, but for when that's not enough,
          you can add your own custom logic to Kill Bill in the form of
          Plugin code that can customize the system behavior to meet
          your specific needs.</section>
        <section id="features">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>Features</h1>
          </div>
          <h3> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
          <h3>Core Features</h3>
          Kill Bill is a fully fledged subscription billing system. This
          section outlines the features that it shares with many
          comparable products on the market.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subscription Management:</span>
          Kill Bill can<br>
          <ul>
            <li>create and cancel subscriptions associated with a
              billing plan</li>
            <li>upgrade and downgrade between plans</li>
            <li>charge customers on a fixed or recurring basis with
              support for multiple billing periods (monthly, quarterly,
              annual etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoices and Proration:</span>
          Kill Bill generates invoices, when they are required and can
          prorate off cycle charges onto a single recurring bill cycle.
          For example, if you have a customer who is billed on the 15th
          of every month and they buy a product on the 1st of January,
          Kill Bill can correctly charge them for the partial month 1st
          - 15th January and then continue to bill them every 15th of
          the month with the new subscription combined with the others.
          Invoices can be automatically emailed to customers.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments: </span>Kill Bill
          triggers payments with your payment providers as soon as an
          invoice has been generated. Payment failure notices can be
          automatically mailed out to customers (also see Overdue
          Enforcement in the Advanced sections). Kill Bill interfaces
          with payment providers via plugin API's that make it easy to
          add new payment providers if you need to interface with
          providers that we do not already support. [Note: plugins for
          Litle and PayPal are currently under development]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting and
            Analytics:&nbsp; </span>Kill Bill supports finance
          reporting (revenue recognition, aging etc.) and business
          dashboards for monitoring acquisition, monthly recurring
          revenue and churn. The reports and analytics can be driven off
          a separate database so that they do not impact production
          performance. [Note: reports and dashboards are currently under
          development]<br>
          <br>
          <h3>Advanced Features<br>
          </h3>
          This section outlines some of the advance features that make
          Kill Bill a little different - and by different we mean
          better.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-phase plans: </span>Do
          you need a plan that offers a 30 day trial followed by&nbsp; a
          6 month discount period and then transitions to a full price
          evergreen subscription? No problem. Kill Bill supports the
          configuration of plans with multiple phases, each phase can
          specify its own pricing and even billing term.<span
            style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan change rules: </span></span>Do

          you need to have trials cancel immediately but have paid plans
          cancel at the end of their term? Maybe you want upgrades to
          take place immediately but downgrades to happen at the end of
          term? All of this is business logic that should live in the
          billing system not in applications. Kill Bill natively
          supports powerful change rules that ensure that plan changes
          and cancellations happen according to your policies. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Product tiers and add-ons:</span>
          So, you want three tiers of product with some add-ons only
          available to the top tier customers. Kill Bill has native
          support for tiered products and add-ons, allowing you to
          specify which add-ons are available on which product tiers and
          if the customer downgrades automatically cancel add-ons that
          are no longer available. Of course, Kill Bill can tell you
          what it's going to do before you do it so your users can
          confirm.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"> <br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Price lists: </span></span></span>You

          want to offer a special set of prices to customers coming in
          through one of your partners. They get a 30% price for six
          months. But what happens if they upgrade during those six
          months? Maybe you want them to stay in the same price list and
          get 30% off the new plan, but only for the remainder of the
          discount period. With Kill Bill you can arrange plans into
          Price Lists and provide Plan Change rules to specify exactly
          he behavior you need.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
                Overdue Enforcement:</span></span></span> Kill Bill
          allows you to write rules<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
              style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
                bold;"> </span></span></span>to specify what happens
          when a customer payment fails. You can choose to take
          different actions based on the payment failure type, the
          customer's plan, the time since the last unpaid invoice etc.
          This allows you to build multi-phased enforcement where the
          customer can receive warnings and have features gradually
          removed until they are finally shut down.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
                Internationalization: </span></span></span>Kill Bill
          understands the internationalization of currency
          representation, so that it provides the correct decimal
          separator, number of decimal places and rounding rules for
          each locale. All customer interactions, emails, invoices etc.
          are fully internationalized so you can create invoice and
          email templates to match the locales of your customers. [Note:
          this feature is currently incomplete]<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
                Time zones: </span></span></span>You have a customer in
          Japan that buys a product on March 3rd. However, your
          California based billing provider sends her invoices that
          start her subscription on March 2nd because it was still March
          2nd in California when the purchase was made. This can be very
          confusing to customers. Kill Bill does time zones right. Your
          customer accounts have a time zone associated with them and
          your customers are invoiced in that time zone.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"><br>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Event based: </span></span></span>Most

          cloud based providers have offline billing and payment runs
          that introduce a delay of sometimes up to 48 hours between
          when a customer signs up and when their card is charged. Kill
          Bill runs as an event based system, as soon a subscription is
          created that triggers an event, which triggers the creation of
          an invoice, and in turn, triggers a payment. The customer's
          card will be charged within seconds of signing up which is
          better for you and less confusing for them.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
              bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
                Coupons:</span></span></span> Need a way to let some of
          your customers access that special discount price list? Kill
          Bill lets you create and manage coupons. Each coupon has an
          expiry date (can be unlimited) and a maximum number of uses
          (can also be unlimited) and gets mapped to a specific price
          list. [Note: this feature is under development]<span
            style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
                style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
                <br>
              </span></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
              style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
                bold;"></span></span></span>
          <h3>Plugins</h3>
          In today's world the ability to rapidly test and roll out
          promotions, alternate pricing models<span style="font-weight:
            bold;"></span> and custom billing features is critical to
          your companies ability to compete. With conventional
          cloud-based subscription solutions you are limited to the
          capabilities that they offer. Before Kill Bill the only way to
          have complete control over your billing behavior was by
          building your own billing system from scratch and few
          companies have the skills or resources to do that. Kill Bill
          resolves this dilemma by providing the first Billing Platform.
          Our plugin architecture allows you to add custom logic that
          can be triggered by events in the system. Which means that the
          only logic that you need to build are the customizations.<br>
          <br>
          Our plugin system uses the <a
