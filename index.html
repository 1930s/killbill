        <h1>Subscription Billing made easy</h1>
        <p class="lead">Adding a payment solution to your website should be easy: capture the credit card information via a third-party payment gateway and issue an API call for a given amount. Recurring billing is similar: do and repeat every month. Want a trial period of 30 days? Delay the initial payment. But now you want to add a second offering with a different price point. And a different trial period length. And support multiple currencies. And create rules to control upgrades and downgrades...</p>
        <p class="lead">We believe billing should be easy. Killbill is an open-source (Apache License 2.0) billing platform which solves these problems and much more.</p>
