  </div>
  <p>
  Kill Bill sits at the center of your business. It
  understands your catalog and manages customer purchases and
  plan changes (upgrades, downgrades and cancellations). It
  knows what plans a customer has subscribed to and can
  provide that information to other systems, including your
  product. It creates invoices on a regular basis, triggers
  payments against your payment providers (PayPal, Credit Card
  Gateway etc.) and can produce finance reports and business
  analytics.
  </p>
  <p>
  All subscription management services provide these basic
  functions. What makes Kill Bill different is that we provide
  you with the flexibility to truly customize the system to your
  needs. We believe that it is critically important that the
  billing system owns all the business logic to manage how plan
  changes take place or which add-ons are available to a given
  plan, or even to manage the custom business logic&nbsp; around
  promotions or dunnings that sets you apart from your
  competition. To support these advanced features Kill Bill has
  flexible rules that can express a wide variety of plan changes
  and cancellation behaviors, but for when that's not enough,
  you can add your own custom logic to Kill Bill in the form of
  Plugin code that can customize the system behavior to meet
  your specific needs.

    <h1>Features</h1>
  </div>
  <h2>Core Features</h2>
  <p>
  Kill Bill is a fully fledged subscription billing system. This
  section outlines the features that it shares with many
  comparable products on the market.
  </p>

  <h3>Subscription Management</h3>
  <p>Kill Bill can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>create and cancel subscriptions associated with a billing plan</li>
    <li>upgrade and downgrade between plans</li>
    <li>charge customers on a fixed or recurring basis with
      support for multiple billing periods (monthly, quarterly,
      annual etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Invoices and Proration</h3>
  <p>
  Kill Bill generates invoices, when they are required and can
  prorate off cycle charges onto a single recurring bill cycle.
  For example, if you have a customer who is billed on the 15th
  of every month and they buy a product on the 1st of January,
  Kill Bill can correctly charge them for the partial month 1st
  - 15th January and then continue to bill them every 15th of
  the month with the new subscription combined with the others.
  Invoices can be automatically emailed to customers.
  </p>

  <h3>Payments</h3>
  <p>
  Kill Bill triggers payments with your payment providers as soon as an
  invoice has been generated. Payment failure notices can be
  automatically mailed out to customers (also see Overdue
  Enforcement in the Advanced sections). Kill Bill interfaces
  with payment providers via plugin API's that make it easy to
  add new payment providers if you need to interface with
  providers that we do not already support.
  </p>

  <h3>Reporting and Analytics</h3>
  <p>
  Kill Bill supports finance reporting (revenue recognition, aging etc.) and business
  dashboards for monitoring acquisition, monthly recurring
  revenue and churn. The reports and analytics can be driven off
  a separate database so that they do not impact production
  performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Advanced Features</h3>
  <p>
  This section outlines some of the advance features that make
  Kill Bill a little different - and by different we mean
  better.
  </p>

  <h4>Multi-phase plans</h4>
  <p>
  Do you need a plan that offers a 30 day trial followed by a
  6 month discount period and then transitions to a full price
  evergreen subscription? No problem. Kill Bill supports the
  configuration of plans with multiple phases, each phase can
  specify its own pricing and even billing term.
  </p>

  <h4>Plan change rules</h4>
  <p>
  Do you need to have trials cancel immediately but have paid plans
  cancel at the end of their term? Maybe you want upgrades to
  take place immediately but downgrades to happen at the end of
  term? All of this is business logic that should live in the
  billing system not in applications. Kill Bill natively
  supports powerful change rules that ensure that plan changes
  and cancellations happen according to your policies.
  </p>

  <h4>Product tiers and add-ons:</h4>
  <p>
  So, you want three tiers of product with some add-ons only
  available to the top tier customers. Kill Bill has native
  support for tiered products and add-ons, allowing you to
  specify which add-ons are available on which product tiers and
  if the customer downgrades automatically cancel add-ons that
  are no longer available. Of course, Kill Bill can tell you
  what it's going to do before you do it so your users can
  confirm.
  </p>

  <h4>Price lists</h4>
  <p>
  You want to offer a special set of prices to customers coming in
  through one of your partners. They get a 30% price for six
  months. But what happens if they upgrade during those six
  months? Maybe you want them to stay in the same price list and
  get 30% off the new plan, but only for the remainder of the
  discount period. With Kill Bill you can arrange plans into
  Price Lists and provide Plan Change rules to specify exactly
  he behavior you need.
  </p>

  <h4>Overdue Enforcement</h4>
  <p>
  Kill Bill allows you to write rules to specify what happens
  when a customer payment fails. You can choose to take
  different actions based on the payment failure type, the
  customer's plan, the time since the last unpaid invoice etc.
  This allows you to build multi-phased enforcement where the
  customer can receive warnings and have features gradually
  removed until they are finally shut down.
  </p>

  <h4>Internationalization</h4>
  <p>
  Kill Bill understands the internationalization of currency
  representation, so that it provides the correct decimal
  separator, number of decimal places and rounding rules for
  each locale. All customer interactions, emails, invoices etc.
  are fully internationalized so you can create invoice and
  email templates to match the locales of your customers.
  </p>

  <h4>Time zones</h4>
  <p>
  You have a customer in Japan that buys a product on March 3rd. However, your
  California based billing provider sends her invoices that
  start her subscription on March 2nd because it was still March
  2nd in California when the purchase was made. This can be very
  confusing to customers. Kill Bill does time zones right. Your
  customer accounts have a time zone associated with them and
  your customers are invoiced in that time zone.
  </p>

  <h4>Event based</h4>
  <p>
  Most cloud based providers have offline billing and payment runs
  that introduce a delay of sometimes up to 48 hours between
  when a customer signs up and when their card is charged. Kill
  Bill runs as an event based system, as soon a subscription is
  created that triggers an event, which triggers the creation of
  an invoice, and in turn, triggers a payment. The customer's
  card will be charged within seconds of signing up which is
  better for you and less confusing for them.
  </p>

  <h4>Coupons</h4>
  <p>
  Need a way to let some of your customers access that special discount price list? Kill
  Bill lets you create and manage coupons. Each coupon has an
  expiry date (can be unlimited) and a maximum number of uses
  (can also be unlimited) and gets mapped to a specific price
  list. [Note: this feature is under development]
  </p>

  <h2>Plugins</h2>
  <p>
  In today's world the ability to rapidly test and roll out
  promotions, alternate pricing models and custom billing features is critical to
  your companies ability to compete. With conventional
  cloud-based subscription solutions you are limited to the
  capabilities that they offer. Before Kill Bill the only way to
  have complete control over your billing behavior was by
  building your own billing system from scratch and few
  companies have the skills or resources to do that. Kill Bill
  resolves this dilemma by providing the first Billing Platform.
  Our plugin architecture allows you to add custom logic that
  can be triggered by events in the system. Which means that the
  only logic that you need to build are the customizations.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our plugin system uses the OSGi standard and today we support plugins written in either Java or Ruby.
